# project-template


Don't use this if you have limited resources:
---
1. Nextjs - this adds a lot of complexity to the project.
    Use it only if you have separate front-end team. 
    Use React the classic way. 
2. FastAPI - the same as Nextjs but it is back-end story.
    Use Django instead of, development 3x faster.
